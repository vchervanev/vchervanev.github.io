# Intro

Welcome to my homepage ðŸ˜€I'm a software engineer, originally from Russia ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡ºand temporarily working in Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º

## Online Profiles
The most complete one is [LinkedIn](//linkedin.com/in/vladimir-chervanev).

You can see some examples of my code at [Github](//github.com/vchervanev). Those project are not commercial or production-ready Open Source but they are important part of my professional development.

Also I am not an active [StackOverflow's](//stackoverflow.com/users/3849063/vladimir-chervanev) contributor, but my the only asked question seems to be quite useful. Also there are few popular answers there.

## Work Experience
You can see my detailed employment history at [LinkedIn](//linkedin.com/in/vladimir-chervanev). I started to work as a intern software developer in 2002. And I can see three main stages in my career.

First few years of my employment I spent mostly as a Delphi (ObjectPascal) and Oracle (SQL, PL/SQL, database design) developer of some client-server applications. That gave me amazing experience, I was working in GC-less environment, designing desktop UI and client-server interaction (API) and implementing complex data transformations (for example billing systems).

Then my passion for the ideal work process organization led me to be a Team Leader and even a Technical Project Manager later. My team, clients and managers were happy... But I didn't share their happiness. I dreamed about beautiful code and solid application architectures but had to pay more attention to the team management and working processes. That's why I decided to became a well grounded developer again. The transition included a lot of learning and ended up in [Magenta Technology](https://magenta-technology.com/) in 2012 when I joined a wonderful agile world of Cloud Services, Continuous Integration and Unit Testing.

That's how my career of a modern backend/full-stack developer has started. Now I have a very clear vision of not only ideal code but also about ideal company culture and values. I'm happy to conclude that my recent employments show a great match of my and employers expectations both in technical and personal areas.

## My Hobbies
### Algorithms, Math & Competitive programming

I'm not a top-rated competitive programmer (my excuse is my love to write a nice code) but I like algorithms and troubleshooting parts of any competitive coding challenge. I've tried different platforms (see my profiles at [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/members/vchervanev/),
[Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/profile/Vlacher?locale=en),
[Timus](http://acm.timus.ru/author.aspx?id=152177),
[Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/chervanev),
and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/vchervanev/)) and got some good results.

The most pleasant one (at that time) was [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/chervanev) and I even created a testing helper (see this [Github project](https://github.com/vchervanev/cprspec)) to be able to write tests inside my solutions (some examples are [here](https://github.com/vchervanev/hr)). Also I adore Harckerank's adoption of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) (a math-focused contest) and have submitted some solutions there (see [my rating](https://www.hackerrank.com/results/projecteuler/chervanev)).

But then I tried [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/vchervanev/) and now it's my favorite algorithmic playground.

Occasionally I participate in other coding competitions, similar to [Russian AI Cup](http://russianaicup.ru/?locale=en).

Few years ago I was ranked as 129 out of 2000:

 and you can find my Java implementation on [Github](https://github.com/vchervanev/RAIC-12) (and a local [debug tool](https://github.com/vchervanev/graph-srv-raic-12)). Or check out how it was working: YouTube's [recording #1](https://youtu.be/FUX661FSpVU), [recording #2](https://youtu.be/1OVk4o5JIxw).

### Sample Projects

\[WIP\] **[Secret Scrum Poker](https://github.com/vchervanev/secret-scrum-poker)** (Golang server, ReactJS client, WebSockets, Docker+Heroku deployment)
A tool to play Scrum Planning Poker _anonymously_. I believe it can be depressing for some less experienced team members to admit that they don't completely understand something when their estimation significantly differs from others. An anonymous vote would allow them to safely "play" XL card to call for another round of discussion.

**[Web Demo Project](https://github.com/vchervanev/webs-demo)** (Ruby/Sinatra, AngularJS, Redis, deployed to Heroku: http://webs-demo.herokuapp.com/). Responsive HTML "from scratch", endless scrolling, Redis data loader.

**[Ping-pong tournament table](https://github.com/vchervanev/championship)** (Ruby/Jekyll, AngularJS, hosted by Github Pages: http://vchervanev.github.io/championship). The project uses Jekyll to parse input data from YAML files and to render static JS. Also a [custom plugin](https://github.com/vchervanev/haml4gh) was created to add HAML support to Github Pages (standard plugin couldn't be used due to the runtime limitations).

**[High Load Cup solution](https://github.com/vchervanev/d9a1ef00)** (Golang, Docker) An unsuccessful attempt to compete in a Russian High Load competition. The only finished part is a JSON parser with zero-memory allocation (see [tests](https://github.com/vchervanev/d9a1ef00/blob/master/src/bjson/bjson_test.go) and [implementation](https://github.com/vchervanev/d9a1ef00/tree/master/src/bjson)). Unfortunately the [competition site](https://highloadcup.ru/) is not translated to English.

**[Image Dimensions Information Proxy](https://github.com/vchervanev/img-debug-proxy)** (Golang) a toy project: http proxy to add dimensions labels to loaded images.
